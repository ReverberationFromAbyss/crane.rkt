## Background

It is a part of Lilies project.
A toy interpreter and compiler front-end for learning purpose

The major I took is ICS(Information and Compute Science), and it provide no program about compile principle.

This is first part of Lilies project:
1. Regular expression engine, Crane.rkt
2. Lexer, GnuPowder.rkt
3. Parse,
4. Semantic analyze & interpreter,
5. Language based optimizer & IR generator,
6. (Maybe) Compiler backend

After all, it is obviously a small win if it can work at last.
